## Troubleshooting

If the app is not functioning as expected, try the following steps:

- **Check your internet connection**: Since LexiFinder uses an external API, an internet connection is required to retrieve word data.
- **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes old cached data might interfere with new updates.
- **API rate limits**: The Dictionary API has a rate limit, so avoid making too many requests within a short period.

If issues persist, feel free to raise an issue on the repository.
